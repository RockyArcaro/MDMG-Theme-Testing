        <p>
        Since 2004, World Cafe Live has been at the heart of Philadelphia’s music scene. Created in partnership with WXPN, our venue quickly became a popular hub for music lovers, hosting local, national, and international acts. In 2008, we partnered with nonprofit LiveConnections to boost music education in the city, officially merging in 2019. Today, as one nonprofit, we continue to celebrate live music and inspire our community with memorable shows and programs.
